### Installation Methods

#### Method 1: Quick Install from Source

The recommended way to install Lumo is by building from source:

```bash
# Clone the Lumo repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/agnath18K/lumo.git

# Navigate into the cloned repository
cd lumo

# Build the binary
make build

# Install the binary to /usr/bin for global access
sudo cp build/lumo /usr/bin/lumo

# Verify the installation
lumo --version
```

#### Method 2: Using Pre-built Binaries

If you prefer not to build from source, you can download pre-built binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/agnath18K/lumo/releases):

```bash
# Download the latest release for your platform (example for Linux amd64)
curl -L https://github.com/agnath18K/lumo/releases/latest/download/lumo-linux-amd64 -o lumo

# Make the binary executable
chmod +x lumo

# Move to a directory in your PATH
sudo mv lumo /usr/bin/lumo

# Verify the installation
lumo --version
```

### First-Time Setup and Configuration

When you first run Lumo, it will guide you through an interactive setup process:

1. **Configuration Initialization**:
   - Lumo automatically creates the necessary configuration directory at `~/.config/lumo/`
   - Default configuration files are generated if they don't exist

2. **AI Provider Selection**:
   - You'll be prompted to choose your preferred AI provider:
     - **Google Gemini**: Generally faster with good performance for terminal tasks
     - **OpenAI**: May provide more detailed explanations for complex queries
     - **Ollama**: Local AI inference without requiring internet connectivity

3. **API Key Configuration**:
   - You'll need to provide API keys for your chosen provider(s):
     - For **Gemini**: Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
     - For **OpenAI**: Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
     - For **Ollama**: Provide the URL where Ollama is running (default: http://localhost:11434)

4. **Key Verification and Storage**:
   - Lumo will verify your API keys to ensure they're valid
   - Keys are securely stored in your configuration file
   - You can update keys later by editing `~/.config/lumo/config.json`

5. **Feature Enablement**:
   - By default, most features are enabled
   - You can customize which features are active in the configuration file

4. Run tests to ensure everything works (`make test`)
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

### Continuous Integration and Deployment

Lumo uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

- **CI Workflow**: Automatically runs tests and builds the binary for each push to the main branch and pull requests
- **Release Workflow**: Automatically builds binaries for multiple platforms and creates a GitHub release when a new tag is pushed
- **GoReleaser**: Used for streamlined release management, packaging, and distribution

To create a new release:

```bash
# Update version in pkg/version/version.go
# Commit the changes
git commit -am "Release version X.Y.Z"

# Tag the release
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Version X.Y.Z"

# Push the changes and tags
git push && git push --tags
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
1. Build binaries for Linux, macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
2. Create Debian packages
3. Generate checksums
4. Create a GitHub release with all artifacts attached
